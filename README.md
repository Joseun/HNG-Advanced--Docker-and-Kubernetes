# HNG Advanced Docker and Kubernetes Crash Course

The HNG Advanced two weeks crash course on Docker and Kubernetes was designed to equip developers with practical skills in containerization and orchestration, focusing on Docker and Kubernetes. The classes were an immersive learning adventure that elevtaed our skills.

## Overview

This repository contains a React FastAPI application that I deployed locally and onto Kubernetes clusters using Docker, Kind (Kubernetes in Docker), Kubectl, Helm, and other relevant tools. Through practical sessions and coding assignments, I gained a comprehensive understanding of containerization concepts and how to manage containerized applications in production environments across different operating systems.

In this crash course, we will delved into the following key concepts:

- Docker fundamentals: Understanding containers, images, and Dockerfile.
- Docker Compose: Managing multi-container applications.
- Kubernetes basics: Deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.
- Helm: Managing Kubernetes applications with Helm charts.
- Ingress: Routing external traffic to your Kubernetes services.


## React FastAPI App Deployment

To deploy the React FastAPI app on your local machine, follow these steps detailed at [React FastAPI App](https://github.com/Idimmusix/react-fastapi-app/tree/main)


## Completed Assignments

Throughout the course, I completed various assignments that involved configuring Kubernetes manifests, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more. Each assignment built upon the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity to reinforce my understanding of the concepts covered in the crash course.

## Goal Achieved

I successfully gained hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes across different operating systems and tools. I can now confidently deploy and manage containerized applications in real-world scenarios, adapting to various environments and requirements.
